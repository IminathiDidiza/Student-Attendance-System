# System Specification

## Project Title
Student Attendance Tracking System

## Domain
**Education Management Systems**

This system falls within the domain of education management systems, focusing on attendance management in educational institutions like schools, colleges and universities. The education sector requires efficient tracking and management of student attendance for administrative, academic, and regulatory purposes.

## Problem Statement
Traditional paper-based attendance tracking methods in educational institutions are inefficient, prone to errors and difficult to analyze. Key issues include:

1. Time-consuming manual recording and compilation of attendance data
2. Difficulty in generating timely reports for administration and parents
3. Lack of real-time attendance insights for instructors and administrators
4. Inability to automatically notify stakeholders about attendance issues
5. Challenges in maintaining and accessing historical attendance records

The Student Attendance Tracking System aims to address these issues by providing a digital solution that automates attendance recording, reporting and notification processes.

## Individual Scope
This project is feasible as an individual project due to the following factors:

1. **Well-defined boundary**: The system focuses specifically on attendance management rather than attempting to be a comprehensive school management system.

2. **Manageable technical complexity**: The system requires standard web development technologies without complex integrations or advanced AI components.

3. **Modular architecture**: The system can be built with clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, database), allowing for iterative development.

4. **Limited user roles**: The system primarily serves three user types: students, instructors, and administrators.

5. **Established patterns**: Attendance tracking follows predictable patterns and business rules that can be clearly defined.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management
- FR1: The system shall allow administrators to register and manage user accounts
- FR2: The system shall support three user roles: student, instructor, and administrator
- FR3: The system shall allow users to reset their passwords

### Authentication
- FR4: The system shall require users to authenticate using username and password
- FR5: The system shall automatically log out inactive users after 30 minutes

### Attendance Recording
- FR6: The system shall allow instructors to create class sessions
- FR7: The system shall allow instructors to mark attendance for students
- FR8: The system shall allow students to self-check-in using a unique code provided by the instructor
- FR9: The system shall record timestamp information with each attendance entry

### Reporting
- FR10: The system shall generate attendance reports by class, student, or date range
- FR11: The system shall allow export of reports in PDF and CSV formats
- FR12: The system shall display attendance statistics on user dashboards

### Notifications
- FR13: The system shall send automated notifications when student attendance falls below 75%
- FR14: The system shall send class reminders to students

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- NFR1: The system shall load pages within 3 seconds under normal usage conditions
- NFR2: The system shall support up to 100 concurrent users

### Security
- NFR3: The system shall encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest
- NFR4: The system shall implement role-based access control
- NFR5: The system shall maintain an audit log of all attendance modifications

### Usability
- NFR6: The system shall be accessible on mobile and desktop devices
- NFR7: The system shall provide a user interface that requires minimal training

### Reliability
- NFR8: The system shall be available 99% of the time during school hours
- NFR9: The system shall back up data daily

## Constraints
- The system must be deployable on standard cloud hosting platforms
- The system must comply with educational data privacy regulations
- The system development must be completable by a single developer within a reasonable timeframe

## Use Cases

### UC1: Record Attendance (Instructor)
**Primary Actor**: Instructor
**Preconditions**: Instructor is authenticated
**Main Flow**:
1. Instructor selects a class session
2. System displays the student list for that class
3. Instructor marks each student as present or absent
4. System saves the attendance record
**Alternative Flow**:
- Instructor generates a check-in code for student self-check-in

### UC2: View Attendance Record (Student)
**Primary Actor**: Student
**Preconditions**: Student is authenticated
**Main Flow**:
1. Student selects a course
2. System displays the attendance record for that course
3. Student views their attendance statistics

### UC3: Generate Attendance Report (Administrator)
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Preconditions**: Administrator is authenticated
**Main Flow**:
1. Administrator selects report parameters (class, date range, etc.)
2. System generates the report based on selected parameters
3. Administrator views or downloads the report
