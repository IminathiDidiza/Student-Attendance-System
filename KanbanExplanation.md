What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that represents work as it moves through different stages of completion. The word "Kanban" comes from Japanese, roughly translating to "visual signal" or "card." The board uses cards (representing tasks) arranged in columns (representing stages of work) to provide a visual representation of the workflow.

At its core, a Kanban board is designed to:

Visualize the workflow and make work visible to all team members
Limit work in progress (WIP) to prevent overloading team capacity
Manage flow to ensure smooth progression of tasks
Make process policies explicit so everyone understands how work moves
Implement feedback loops to enable continuous improvement
How Our Board Visualizes Workflow

Our customized Kanban board for the Attendance Tracking System visualizes our development workflow through these columns:

Backlog: Contains all user stories from our product backlog that have been identified but not yet prioritized for current work
To Do: Tasks from the current sprint that are prioritized and ready to be worked on
In Analysis: Tasks currently being analyzed and designed before implementation begins
In Development: Tasks actively being coded by team members
In Testing: Completed development work that's undergoing quality assurance testing
Ready for Deployment: Tasks that have passed testing and are ready to be deployed
Done: Tasks that have been completed, tested, and deployed to production
Blocked: Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies or impediments
Each column represents a distinct phase in our development process, making it clear where every task stands at any given time. This transparency helps team members understand what's happening across the project without needing constant status meetings.

Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

Our board implements WIP limits to prevent overloading and ensure consistent flow:

In Analysis: Maximum of 3 tasks
In Development: Maximum of 5 tasks
In Testing: Maximum of 4 tasks
These limits help us identify bottlenecks quickly. For example, if the "In Development" column reaches its limit of 5 tasks, team members should help complete these tasks before pulling in new work. This prevents situations where many tasks are started but few are finished, which would delay delivering value to users.

How Our Board Supports Agile Principles

Visibility: Our board provides a real-time visual representation of all work, making progress and bottlenecks immediately apparent to the entire team. This supports the Agile principle of transparency.
Continuous Delivery: By limiting WIP and focusing on completing items rather than just starting them, we maintain a steady flow of completed features, supporting the Agile principle of delivering working software frequently.
Adaptability: The "Blocked" column helps us quickly identify and address impediments, allowing us to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to challenges as they arise.
Team Collaboration: The visual nature of the board facilitates daily stand-ups and encourages team members to help each other clear bottlenecks, supporting Agile's focus on individuals and interactions.
Continuous Improvement: By tracking how cards move through our workflow, we can identify patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities for process improvement, supporting the Agile principle of regular reflection and adjustment.
