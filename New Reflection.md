# Reflection on Student Attendance System Design

## Challenges Faced

Designing the Student Attendance System presented several key challenges. Determining the appropriate level of entity granularity required careful consideration—I ultimately opted to treat "Program" and "Department" as attributes rather than separate entities to maintain clarity. Modeling the Student-Course relationship was another challenge, where I introduced an Enrollment class to properly capture enrollment-specific data despite adding complexity. Representing attendance states while supporting verification processes and exception handling also required thoughtful design decisions.

## Alignment with Previous Assignments

This class diagram aligns with hypothetical previous assignments through its support of key use cases including student check-ins, instructor attendance-taking, absence request processing, report generation, and student notifications. The design accommodates the complete attendance lifecycle from enrollment to reporting, with attendance records following appropriate state transitions (not recorded → present/absent/late → potentially excused). The diagram supports both functional requirements (tracking, reporting) and non-functional requirements (data integrity, communication).

## Trade-offs Made

Several design trade-offs were necessary:

1. Limited entity granularity to maintain simplicity at the cost of some domain richness
2. Built in flexibility for verification methods and session types, increasing complexity but providing adaptability
3. Used general classes rather than specialized subclasses for conciseness
4. Focused on core attendance functionality rather than modeling the entire educational system
5. Prioritized current operational needs over comprehensive historical data analysis

## Lessons Learned

This exercise reinforced that effective object-oriented design requires thorough domain understanding before modeling begins. The iterative refinement process was essential for balancing complexity with clarity. Properly modeling relationships proved as important as defining the entities themselves. A complete design must address both structure (attributes) and behavior (methods), while remaining flexible enough to accommodate future changes. Ultimately, the model must balance technical requirements with practical user needs to create a system that effectively serves students, instructors, and administrators in attendance management.
