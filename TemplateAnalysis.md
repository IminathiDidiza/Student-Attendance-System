| Template Name | Default Columns | Automation Features | Agile Compatibility | Strengths | Limitations |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|

| Automated Kanban | To do, In progress, Done | Auto-moves issues when PRs are linked and merged | Good for development teams using PRs regularly | Reduces manual updates, integrates with code changes, maintains accuracy | Limited automation options beyond PR-related movements |
| Automated Kanban with reviews | To do, In progress, In review, Done | Auto-moves issues between columns based on PR creation, reviews, and merges | Excellent for teams with formal code review processes | Built-in review stage matches software development lifecycle, enforces quality gates | More complex than needed for projects without formal reviews |

## Template Selection Justification

For our Attendance Tracking System project, I've selected the **Automated Kanban** template because:

1. Our sprint planning from Assignment 6 shows we have a development team working on various components that will likely involve pull requests
2. The automated movement of issues when PRs are linked and merged will maintain an accurate board with minimal manual intervention
3. The simplicity of the template (compared to the review-focused version) matches our team structure which doesn't explicitly mention a dedicated review phase in the sprint tasks
4. We can easily customize it to include our specific workflow stages while maintaining the automation benefits
5. The template provides sufficient flexibility to incorporate our sprint backlog tasks from Assignment 6 while keeping the board focused on our core development activities

While the "Automated Kanban with reviews" template offers more granular tracking of the review process, our current sprint plan doesn't emphasize a separate review phase. The "Basic Kanban" lacks the automation features that would benefit our development workflow. Therefore, the "Automated Kanban" template offers the right balance of automation and simplicity for our project's current needs.
