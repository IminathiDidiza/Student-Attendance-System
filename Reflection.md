## Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs  

## Introduction  
Creating requirements for the Student Attendance Tracking System was challenging because different stakeholders wanted different things. This reflection describes the main challenges I faced and how I tried to solve them.  

## Challenges Faced  

### 1. Making it Simple but Powerful  
**Challenge:** Students and teachers wanted something simple and fast to use, but administrators and regulators needed detailed reports and features.  

**How I Solved It:**  
- Created different interfaces for different users - students see simple screens, administrators see more complex options  
- Added features gradually as users become more familiar with the system  
- Focused on the most important features that benefit multiple groups  

### 2. Speed vs. Record-Keeping  
**Challenge:** Users wanted the system to be fast, but keeping detailed records for regulations can slow things down.  

**How I Solved It:**  
- Set specific performance requirements that must be met even with all features turned on  
- Suggested processing non-urgent tasks (like detailed logging) in the background  
- Included requirements for archiving old data to keep the system running smoothly  

### 3. Security vs. Ease of Use  
**Challenge:** Strong security (like frequent password changes and timeouts) can make the system annoying to use.  

**How I Solved It:**  
- Added security measures that change based on risk (like fewer restrictions on campus networks)  
- Included different login options that are both secure and convenient  
- Made sure timeouts come with warnings so users don't lose their work  

### 4. Limited Resources vs. Many Requests  
**Challenge:** There were many feature requests but limited resources since this is an individual project.  

**How I Solved It:**  
- Prioritized features based on what users needed most, not just what they wanted  
- Designed the system so new features can be added later  
- Focused on core functionality first  

### 5. Different Ideas of Success  
**Challenge:** Different stakeholders measured success differently - students wanted minimal effort, administrators wanted detailed analysis.  

**How I Solved It:**  
- Created success metrics for each stakeholder group  
- Designed features that satisfy multiple success metrics at once  
- Balanced technical measurements with user satisfaction  

## Conclusion  
Creating requirements for this system meant finding the right balance between different needs. The most important lesson was that good requirements aren't about making everyone 100% happy but finding the best compromise that delivers value to all stakeholders while staying realistic about what can be built.  

I focused on the most essential features that solve the biggest problems for each stakeholder group while keeping the project doable for one developer. By connecting requirements directly to stakeholder concerns, I could justify my decisions and make sure no group was completely left out.
